//@purpose: This is my first C++ program and it simply prints the srting hello world! to the console

//include the iostream directive
#include <iostream>

//define the main() function/method
int main() 
{
    //use the std output for the console and print the Hello world! string and create a new line using endl;
    std::cout<<"hello world!"<<std::endl; 

}
